# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Course
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The main goal was to prepare tidy data set.I created a R script in which i merged the two sets two create one ,extract measurement of mean and standard deviation for each measurement and then created a independent tidy data set  with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
